# ImageProcessing

**ImageProcessing** is a Python library designed to automate batch-scale processing and analysis of large TIFF images. The **ImageProcessing** methods are designed for use with immunofluorescence images on black backgrounds, especially [RNAscope](https://acdbio.com/rnascope%E2%84%A2-basescope%E2%84%A2-and-mirnascope%E2%84%A2assays). The **ImageProcessing** module contains loop- and multiprocessing-based methods to automate any method used to process images, and contains methods to process images for RNAscope and colocalization using several well known methods such as Costes, PCC, and median subtraction.
